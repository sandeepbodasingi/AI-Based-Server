This project report contains the details of what I have learnt throughout the three monthsâ€™ time period. The main aim of the project was to facilitate communication with RADARs by utilizing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for data analysis, AI Model training for classification and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) programming for real-time data exchange. In this project, we have implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the Iris dataset, split the data into training and testing sets, hosted the trained SVM model on a UDP server, and developed an AI server for accepting real time data from external systems as input. Additionally, we have created a client program to send data to the AI server and receive responses. This client system program demonstrates the way in which external systems can connect to AI Server. Radar systems are indispensable in various industries, providing crucial data for decision-making, monitoring, and safety. To further improve communication with RADARs, our project aims to leverage machine learning techniques for data analysis and UDP programming for real-time data exchange.
